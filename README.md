# Landing-Page
This is my second project from The Odin Project curriculum.
The goal of this project is to create an entire webpage from beggining to end by using HTML and CSS.
The Odin Project provides two images to serve as templates.
I have provided both images in this repository to compare the disired outcome and my final product.
